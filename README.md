# NonNegativeLASSO-PortfolioReplication
Team project on Business and Financial data. In this project we show one approach to compute portfolio replication. We will exploit non negative LASSO regression in order to identify correct regressor to predict a given index. 

We will use Sp500 as objective index to replicate and we will try to propose two different investment strategies. The first strategy analyzed is passive, the second one will be active.
